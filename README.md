# ETL_job_Demo_Code

ETL Job Demo Code
This repository demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline in Python for educational purposes. The project includes code to extract data, apply transformations, and load it into a target system. The main goal is to help learners understand how to build and automate ETL workflows.

Contents
